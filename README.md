## 🪄 How It Works
1. **SQL Queries:**  
   Extract and aggregate metrics from the dataset (monthly revenue, category performance, regional revenue, top products, and customers).  
   Stored in `sql/analysis_queries.sql`.

2. **Data Export:**  
   Query results exported from DB Browser → cleaned in Google Sheets → saved as `.csv`.

3. **Tableau Visualization:**  
   CSV files loaded into Tableau Public to create charts and an interactive dashboard.
